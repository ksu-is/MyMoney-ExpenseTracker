# MyMoney-ExpenseTracker
For my project I will develop an expense tracker inspired by this youtube tutorial: https://youtu.be/sYBDJ15dNVc 
This app will help you record and view your expenses using a database through sqlite3.
This app will get user input to record expenses as they happen, and it will allow the user to go back and view their spending habits.
If time permits I would like to add a way to view expenses from certain months and a feature that compares your spending over time to analyze if your spending has gone up or down.
The goal of this app is to make you more conscious about your spending habits.
